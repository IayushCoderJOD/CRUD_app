I have uploaded the build package in the files sections because uploading the whole react project including node modules is not a good practise..

ps- I have implemented all the CRUD operations on the frontend itslef due to lack of time because my mid semester exams are going on and I'm also suffering from fever , so I decided to keep things simple and sober.. 

Thanks!!
